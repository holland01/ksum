**What I would have done with more time**
    * Definitely would have studied the algorithm in more depth, and looked around for one which was more efficient.
    * I would have considered the possibility that there may be some useful number theory which would come in handy for generating useful unit test
      files within the python script
    * I would have paid  more attention to areas where move semantics or copy elision would be considered useful, in addition to any other language specific features.
    * I would have generated more files and figured out some more thorough testing methods.
